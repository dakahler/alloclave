Memory Profiling, Simplified

Alloclave takes the work out of memory profiling. It integrates easily with your existing application, and seamlessly collects data as your application runs.

This focus on simplicity lets you fix your memory problems faster so you can move on to more important tasks.

Time Shift

Scrub through time as your application is running. See something interesting in the profile? Just move the time slider back in time and take a closer look.

This feature also makes it easy to identify memory leaks by watching the allocation space grow over time.
